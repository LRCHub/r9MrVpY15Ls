Light inside of me, guiding me
Finally, I can see you
And it took me so much time
Light inside of me, guiding me
Finally, I can leave you
(Yeah)
Think I got it right this time
Well, I guess that is just
what I get
'Cause I did what I did
And you said what you said
and meant it
And you really bring out
the best in me
I can not thank you enough
I guess that's why
God's blessing me
Show me so much grace and love
And it's totally because,
yeah, yeah
I got a light inside of me
I got a light that's guiding me
I got a lot of God in me
And I can stand alone
(Alone)
I got a light inside of me
(Ah)
I got a light that's guiding me
(Ah)
And I decided finally to
leave your ass alone
I tell you all of my trauma
(Ah)
You say I am too much drama
(Ah)
I'm always the problem
(Ah)
You run away like nothing,
like nada
It's so hard for you,
I'm too much
And you're not enough for you
It's nobody's fault,
it's nobody's loss
We just had a lot to learn
You were the match that lit
up my path
To show me what bridge to burn
Light inside of me, guiding me
Finally, I can see you
And it took me so much time
Light inside of me, guiding me
Finally, I can leave you
Think I got it right this time
But I guess
(guess)
that is just
(just)
what I get
'Cause I did what I did
And you said what you said,
I meant it
And you really bring out
the best in me
I can not thank you enough
I bet that's why God's
blessing me
Show me so much grace and love
And it's totally because,
yeah, yeah
I got a light inside of me
(Inside)
I got a light that's guiding me
(A guide)
I got a lot of God in me
And I can stand alone
(Alone)
I got a light inside of me
(I got a light)
I got a light that's guiding me
(That's guiding me, a light)
I realize with God with me,
I'll never be alone
Where we'll go, I don't know
This is a different love
This is a destined love
Think it's time that
I say goodbye
Bye, to you
Hello to my true love
Now, it's over
